As a passionate and skilled Penetration Tester, I regularly engage in solving challenges on Hack The Box (HTB), applying my deep knowledge of offensive security techniques to explore, exploit, and document vulnerabilities in real-world simulated environments. Through detailed HTB write-ups, I share my methodologies, from reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation, aiming to educate and inspire fellow security enthusiasts. My comprehensive write-ups cover a wide array of attack vectors, including web applications, network services, and system exploitation, all while emphasizing ethical hacking principles and best practices. These contributions serve as valuable resources for both beginners and experienced professionals looking to sharpen their skills in cybersecurity.
